    <p>
        React is an open-source JavaScript library used for building user interfaces or UI components, 
        particularly for single-page applications where the user interface 
        needs to be dynamic and responsive. It was developed and is maintained by Facebook.
        React allows developers to create reusable UI components and manage the state of the application efficiently.
