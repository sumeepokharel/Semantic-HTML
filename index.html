    </header>

    <p>
        "Java," it is a high-level, versatile, and object-oriented programming language that is
         designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. Java is known for its 
        "write once, run anywhere" (WORA) philosophy, which means that Java code can run on any
         device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

        <h3>Features of Java</h3>
        <li>Platform Independence</li>
        <li>Object-Oriented</li>
        <li>Robust and Secure</li>
        <li>Multithreading</li>
        
    </ul>

       In Java, "oops" usually refers to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles. 
       Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that uses objects, which are instances of classes,
        to organize code. Java is an object-oriented programming language, and it follows the core principles of OOP.
       
    </p>
    <h3> The four main principles of OOP are:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Encapsulation</li>
        <li>Inheritance:</li>
        <li>Polymorphism</li>
        <li>Abstraction:</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Java  supports various data types that are classified into two categories </p>
        <h4>Primitive Data Types</h4>
   <ol>
    <li> byte</li>
    <li>Short</li>
    <li>int</li>
    <li>long</li>
    <li>boolean</li>
    <li>char</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>Non Primitive Data Types</h4>
    <ol>
    <li>Object TYpes</li>
    <li>String</li>
    <li> Array</li>

   </ol>
